Description
-----------
This example shows how to use the editable data and custom mark functionality of PVRScope. PVRTune must be running and connected to an instance of PVRPerfServer running on the target device for this example to function.
 
A simple physically-based shader is provided with properties of Albedo, Metallicity and Glossiness. These, together with the shaders, can be edited from the PVRTune GUI. This allows immediate modification of the appearance of the statue.
